# Appwrite Authentication

This project is made to showcase a simple manner to get up and running with Appwrite. It's using the UI from [Flutter Login Template](https://github.com/Robert-Brunhage-Organization/flutter_login_template).

## Getting Started

Fork and clone this project. This project has only made the changes required to work with Android but I recommend following [Appwrite Flutter docs](https://appwrite.io/docs/getting-started-for-flutter) to add support for more platforms.

After this is done and you have your backend running with appwrite, make sure to update the project id in `main.dart`.
